# Description
Memorotes is a sticky notes style website that allows users to record their memorable moments or vent their feelings by writing a note everyday, but the difference from other note-taking websites is that the note can't be edited or deleted after the day anymore, and then it becomes a "memory note".

## React Hooks
#### useState: to store local states, such as note title, content, timestamp, etc.
#### useEffect: to execute conditional statements or codes, such as updating time, after rendering.
#### useContext: to pass the local states to the sub components.
#### useRef: to get the certain react-dom elements.

## Redux Toolkit
#### slice: to manage global states, such as UI and popups toggles, actions and reducers, so as to simplify the project structure.
#### thunk: to handle async actions and simplify the main components.
#### useDispatch: to dispatch an action to modify the global states.
#### useSelector: to get the global states.
